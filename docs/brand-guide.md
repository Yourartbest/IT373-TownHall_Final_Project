# Brand Guide — Newark AI Town Hall (Neo-Swiss Design System)

A modernized Swiss-style system emphasizing clarity, structure, and community accessibility.

---

# ✦ Design Philosophy (Neo-Swiss)
- Grid-first layout with strong vertical and horizontal alignment  
- Functional typography as the primary design element  
- Minimalism with purpose — every element must justify its existence  
- Bold, clear hierarchy: large headings, clean body text  
- High contrast for visibility and accessibility  
- Generous negative space for breathability  
- Asymmetric but ordered compositions  

---

# ✦ Logo System (Neo-Swiss Approach)
### Primary Logo
- Simple geometric form: square, circle, or modular grid-based icon  
- Avoid gradients, detailed illustrations  
- Works in black or white  
- Symbol can stand alone without text  

### Wordmark
- Set in Inter Bold or Inter ExtraBold  
- Tracking: slightly negative for precision  
- Always left-aligned

# ✦ Color Palette (Neo-Swiss)

Swiss style uses minimal colors. Neo-Swiss adds controlled accent colors.

### Core Palette
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|--------|
| **Black** | #000000 | Primary text, headings, UI elements |
| **White** | #FFFFFF | Background, negative space |
| **Accent Red** (Swiss-inspired) | **#E63946** | CTAs, highlights, critical UI |
| **Supporting Gray** | #F5F5F5 | Soft background sections |
| **Deep Blue** (Community tone) | #1B3A57 | Secondary headings or footer |

**Why Red?**  
Classic Swiss typography uses red/black/white. Keeping a single red accent respects heritage but feels modern.
