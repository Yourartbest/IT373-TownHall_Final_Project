# Problem Statement & Project Goals

## Problem Statement
Many Newark residents lack accessible, plain-language resources to understand artificial intelligence and how it impacts education, work, and community life. Current online resources are too technical, fragmented, or not culturally relevant. Educators lack ready-to-use materials, and student volunteers lack structured ways to help.

The Town Hall website must make AI education **simple, approachable, and community-centered** while providing workflows for events, registration, volunteers, and educators.
