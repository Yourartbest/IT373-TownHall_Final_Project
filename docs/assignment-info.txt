Town Hall - Project Brief

Nice, this is a killer trio for 373. You’ve basically defined a mini ecosystem of AI-era orgs: a design museum, a career accelerator, and a civic nonprofit — all with real workflows.

I’ll walk through this in 4 parts:

    How the three projects fit together (shared systems + mindset)

    MyWebClass.org – goals, workflows, tools, what you can demand from teams

    Job Club – onboarding pipeline, CRM-ish thinking, automations

    Town Hall – events, content, community, and how to make it feel “real”

I’ll keep it assignment-oriented so you can turn this straight into specs.
1. The ecosystem: one “stack”, three orgs

You can frame this to students as:

    “You’re building three organizations that could actually run tomorrow. Your job is to design the workflows, choose the tools, and implement just enough of the stack that a real person could use it.”

Common expectations across all three:

    Professional discovery & UX process

        Stakeholder interviews (even if simulated)

        Personas

        Customer journey maps

        Information architecture / sitemap

        Low-/mid-fidelity wireframes

        Brand guide (logo, colors, typography, tone of voice)

    Tool evaluation

        Compare at least 2 options for each category:

            CMS (Sanity / WordPress / Strapi / Notion-as-CMS, etc.)

            Automation (Zapier / Make / n8n)

            CRM / contact management (HubSpot / Mailchimp / Airtable)

            Community (Discord vs Slack vs “nothing”)

    AI usage

        “Vibe coding” with AI to generate boilerplate, content, and UX ideas

        Use AI for process, not just code: interview scripts, persona drafts, journey maps, brand voice, etc.

    Teams of 2

        One leans slightly toward UX/strategy, one toward implementation, but both must touch everything.

You can even let them share some global infrastructure (e.g., one Discord with separate channels for MyWebClass, Job Club, Town Hall) but separate sites/brands.
2. MyWebClass.org – Design Styles as Living Websites

Concept:
A living gallery of web pages, each one a perfect demo of a design style (Swiss, Bauhaus, Flat, Brutalist, Neumorphism, etc.), wrapped by an umbrella site about “design + web tech.”
Primary users

    Design & CS/IS students

    Teachers looking for examples

    Curious devs/designers

    Future 373 students

Required UX & workflows

a. Design Gallery Submission Workflow

You specifically need:

    Submission form

        Fields:

            Name, email

            Role (student / external contributor / instructor)

            Design style (select from taxonomy)

            URL to live demo (or Git repo)

            Short description: What makes this authentically Swiss/Bauhaus/Flat?

            Assets: screenshots, maybe a Figma link

    Moderation workflow

        States: submitted → under review → approved → rejected

        Someone (instructor or “curator” role) reviews submissions and approves.

    Gallery display

        Filter chips or tags by style (Swiss, Bauhaus, etc.).

        Each gallery item: thumbnail, style, short blurb, link to “Learn more” page.

        Detail page: explanation of the style, what this implementation demonstrates, links to code.

b. CMS & tooling suggestions

    CMS: Sanity is a great teaching example:

        You get strongly-typed schema, modular content modeling, and good API.

        Students define schemas for Style, GalleryEntry, Author, Article.

    Front-end: Next.js / Astro front-end hitting Sanity content.

    Automations with Zapier:

        When a submission form is submitted → create a new CMS document in “submitted” state.

        Notify a #mywebclass-submissions channel in Discord.

        Optionally add submitter to HubSpot as “Design Contributor”.

c. Educational content

Every design style should have:

    A style profile page:

        History (timeline, origin)

        Key characteristics (grid, type, color, layout)

        Web examples

        “Do / Don’t” list

    A canonical web demo:

        Actually implemented page that embodies the style.

        Clear code structure: layout, CSS strategy, typography.

d. AI integration ideas

    Students use AI to:

        Generate first-pass explanations of each design style, then fact-check and refine.

        Generate CSS snippets, but then hand-tune them to match the authentic style.

        Analyze a submitted page: “Explain why this is or isn’t Swiss style.”

Good assignment asks:

For MyWebClass.org, each team must:

    Model at least:

        3–4 design styles

        3+ gallery entries

        2–3 learning articles

    Implement:

        Submission form → CMS doc → moderation workflow

        Approved entries show up automatically in the gallery

    Deliver:

        Personas (e.g., “design student”, “HS teacher”, “self-taught dev”)

        Customer journey: “HS teacher wants examples for a slide deck”

        Brand guide: how MyWebClass.org should look/feel (meta-style above the specific styles)

3. Job Club – AI Careers & Consulting Onboarding Machine

Concept:
A club that onboards students into being AI consultants / startup builders; gives them structure, community, and a “career stack”: LinkedIn, GitHub, personal site, Calendly, Discord, etc.
Primary users

    NJIT students who want an AI-related career (consultant, startup founder, dev).

    Secondary: mentors, alumni, employer partners.

Core requirement: Onboarding workflow

You already defined a strong constraint:

    Students must get LinkedIn, GitHub, personal consulting site, Calendly/Zapier, and join Discord.

Turn that into a concrete pipeline:

    Landing page → “Join Job Club” CTA

    Onboarding form

        Name, major, grad year

        Current links: LinkedIn, GitHub, personal site (if they have them)

        Career goal (consulting, startup, SWE, data, etc.)

        Skill self-assessment

    Automated checklist

        If LinkedIn missing → send “Set up LinkedIn” guide

        If GitHub missing → send “GitHub starter” guide

        If personal site missing → suggest templates (e.g., Notion or simple static)

        Provide a personalized onboarding checklist email/Discord DM.

    Calendly + Zapier

        New member can book a “Career Onboarding Call” (maybe with student leaders).

        Zapier: When an event is booked in Calendly:

            Add/update HubSpot contact with “Onboarding call scheduled”.

            Post in #jobclub-intros channel with key info so mentors can prep.

    Discord integration

        When someone submits the form and confirms email → auto-invite to Discord.

        Roles: member, mentor, admin.

        Optionally assign roles based on self-declared career path.

Events & ongoing support

    Recurring events:

        Weekly standup: “What did you ship for your career this week?”

        Monthly workshop: “Optimize your LinkedIn”, “Cold outreach for consulting gigs”.

    Event system (CMS-based):

        Store events in the same CMS (Sanity/Airtable/HubSpot).

        Events page lists upcoming meetups, online sessions, etc.

        “Add to calendar” links (Google/Outlook).

AI usage baked into the club

You can explicitly require they design AI-powered support flows, such as:

    AI assistant that:

        Reviews your LinkedIn and suggests improvements.

        Creates a GitHub README template.

        Drafts 3 outreach messages to potential clients/employers.

    Discord bot (simple) that:

        Responds to commands like !career-plan to give a template.

        References internal docs.

Good assignment asks:

Job Club teams must:

    Produce a customer journey map for:

        “Student hears about the club → becomes onboarded → lands their first AI-related opportunity (internship, freelance gig, project).”

    Implement:

        Onboarding form → automation → Discord invite + HubSpot record + email with checklist.

        An events page (at least 3 upcoming “fake but plausible” events).

    Provide:

        Persona set: e.g., “Sophomore with zero experience”, “Senior switching from business to AI”, “Grad student already coding.”

        Brand guide: colors, visual tone (optimistic, practical, “builders, not hype”).

4. Town Hall – Newark AI Community Nonprofit

Concept:
A community-facing nonprofit that hosts AI town halls, free training sessions, and has a content hub (blog/vlog) plus Discord for ongoing conversation.
Primary users

    Newark residents (low to moderate tech literacy)

    Local educators, community organizers

    Students & volunteers from NJIT who want to help

Key features & workflows

        Simple form: name, email, neighborhood, interest level.

        Choose event(s) to attend.

    Automation

        On registration:

            Add to HubSpot or mailing list as “Community Member”.

            Send confirmation email (and/or SMS if integrated).

            Optionally auto-generate a Discord invite link.

    Post-event

        Email follow-up with:

            Recording or summary.

            Slide deck link.

            Next events.

b. Content (Blog/Vlog)

    Blog:

        Plain-language posts like “What is AI?”, “How can AI help my small business?”, “AI and privacy: What should I know?”

    Vlog:

        Short recap videos of Town Halls.

    Workflow:

        Editors create content in CMS → mark as draft, ready, published.

        Auto-post to Discord #announcements when new piece is published.

c. Discord community

    Channels like:

        #announcements

        #events

        #ai-questions

        #volunteers

    Automations:

        When someone registers as a volunteer → give them volunteer role in Discord.

        Use Zapier to bridge forms ↔ Discord.

AI usage for Town Hall

    Summarize event transcripts into:

        Blog posts

        “Key takeaways” bullet lists

        Social media copy

    Generate:

        Draft workshop outlines

        Visuals (flyers, banners) with AI assistance (but human review)

Good assignment asks:

Town Hall teams must:

    Design a customer journey like:

        “Newark resident sees a flyer → visits site → registers for event → attends → stays in touch with community.”

    Implement:

        Event creation + listing + registration + confirmation flow.

        Blog/vlog content model in CMS (even if content is minimal).

    Deliver:

        Personas including “low-tech literacy” and “concerned parent / small business owner.”

        Brand guide that emphasizes trust, accessibility, and inclusion.
